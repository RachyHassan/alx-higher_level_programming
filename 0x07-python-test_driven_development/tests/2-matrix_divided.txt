How to use 2-matrix_divided.py
==============================

This module defines a matrix division function " matrix_divided(matrix, div) "

Usage
=====

The function returns a new matrix that is a copy of 'matrix' with all elements divided by 'div'

::

    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
    >>> matrix = [
    ...	  [3, 6, 9],
    ...	  [12, 15, 18]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]

Note: the original matrix is left unchanged.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_is_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

::

    >>> print(matrix)
    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

::

Note: an empty list will raise TypeError

    >>> matrix = None
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

::

However, an empty list of lists will succeed

    >>> matrix = [[]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[]]

::

If matrix is not a list of lists, TypeError is raised

    >>> matrix = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

::

TypeError is raised when an element in the matrix is neither an int or float

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, "hello", 5]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

::

All rows in matrix must be the same, else TypeError is raised.

    >>> matrix = [
    ...      [1, 2, 3],
    ...      [4, 5, 6, 7]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

::

A TypeError is raised when 'div' is neither an int or a float.

    >>> matrix = [
    ...      [1, 2, 3],
    ...      [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 'hello')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be an integer or a float

::

A ZeroDivisionError is raised when div is 0.

    >>> matrix = [
    ...      [1, 2, 3],
    ...      [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
